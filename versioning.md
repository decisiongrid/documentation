1. Choose the scripting rule to create a new version.
2. Click on ![](.gitbook/assets/screenshoteasy-3-%20%281%29.png) button.

### 2. Creating a new version of the scripting rule detail

1. Choose the scripting rule to create a new version.
2. Click on the **name** of the selected scripting rule.
3. Scripting rule detail will be shown.
4. Click on ![](.gitbook/assets/screenshoteasy-3-%20%281%29.png) button.

The button creates a new version of the decision table with the same **Rule Id** as the selected rule and sets the **version to 1 greater than the maximal version.** The new decision table has the **same structure** as the selected rule.

## Scripting rule versions

When you are in scripting rules, you can see all your rules you have in your space. If your rule has more than one version, the **latest** one is shown. For example, the rule **Multiply \(Sample rule\)** has 4 versions. That's why version 4 is shown.
