# Operators

## Information

Every condition cell in the [decision table](../decision-table-designer.md) can have a different operator. There are two types of operators which you can use [**General** ](general-operators.md)and [**Date**](date-operators.md)**.**

### General operators

General operators can be used for basic decision rules where you need to use String, Number or Boolean.
